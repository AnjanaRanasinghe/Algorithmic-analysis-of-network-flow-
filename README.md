# Algorithmic-analysis-of-network-flow-
This repo is for the implementation of a maximum flow solver for the coursework in Algorithmic 
Analysis of Network Flow. The Task was computing the maximum flow between a source node 
and a sink node in a directed graph. For testing purposes, use 39 benchmark files. The 
implementation includes a user-friendly menu to select benchmarked files, compute the maximum 
flow, and output augmenting paths and flow increases.
